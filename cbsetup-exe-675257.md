The version 11.2.0.149 is known for its reliability and efficiency in managing backups, offering features such as scheduling and encryption. Generally, cbSetup.exe is considered safe to use, as it is associated with legitimate software; however, users should always download it from the official website to avoid potential malware infections from third-party sources.
